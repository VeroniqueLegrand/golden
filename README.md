GOLDEN

Golden is a small databanks entries retriever. It searches and displays
entries on indexed databanks `flat' files.

This package currently contains the following programs :
  golden   ... Entries retriever.
  goldin   ... Indexes generator.

Queries/Indexes can be made using entry name, primary accession
numbers or even both (by default).

Currently supported formats : Genbank, Embl, Pir codata, and
assimiled.

To install golden and goldin just do :
./configure
make
[sudo] make install

golden functionnalities can also be exported to python (in order to be called from your python script).
In order to do that, you must of course have python installed on your machine.

These python "bindings" or "exports" were tested with python 2.7.

Alternative installation directory for python binding can be specified via the configure "dir_for_binding_install" variable.
For example:
./configure dir_for_binding_install="/tmp" 
will cause the python binding to be installed in /tmp rather than at the default place (pythonXXX/site-packages).

To install the python binding, just type (whatever configure variables you used):
sudo python setup.py install
